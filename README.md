vimrc
=====
工欲善其事，必先利其器
A simple vim config file, copy .vimrc to ~/.vimrc
first install vundle:
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
Then install plugins in VIM: :PluginInstall
There is just one rule you must follow when crafting your own .vimrc.
Don't put any lines in your vimrc that you don't understand.
